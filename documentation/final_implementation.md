# üì± Campus Lost & Found Service ‚Äì Final Implementation

## üéØ Project Overview

The Campus Lost & Found Service is a mobile-first full-stack application that helps people on our campus report and recover lost and found items. Users (students, faculty, staff) can report items they've found, which creates visible entries for others to browse and retrieve their lost belongings.

Currently session-based. No authentication headers required for MVP.

### Content Type
All endpoints accept and return `application/json`.

### Business Rules and Relationships

1. **User Management**
   - Each user has a unique email address
   - Users can create multiple reports
   - Users can claim multiple items

2. **Location Management**
   - Locations are predefined campus areas
   - Multiple reports can reference the same location
   - Locations can be created, updated, and deleted

3. **Report Workflow**
   - Each report is created by exactly one user
   - Each report is associated with exactly one location
   - Reports can be of type LOST or FOUND
   - Reports start as OPEN and can be marked as RESOLVED
   - A report can contain multiple items

4. **Item Management**
   - Each item belongs to exactly one report
   - Items start as UNCLAIMED
   - Items can be claimed by any user (not necessarily the reporter)
   - When an item is claimed, it's marked as CLAIMED and linked to the claiming user

5. **Data Integrity**
   - All foreign key relationships are enforced
   - Cascading deletes ensure data consistency
   - Timestamps are automatically managed by the database

### Enumerations

#### ReportType
- `LOST` - User reporting a lost item
- `FOUND` - User reporting a found item

#### ReportStatus
- `OPEN` - Report is active and unresolved
- `RESOLVED` - Report has been closed/resolved

#### ItemStatus
- `UNCLAIMED` - Item is available to be claimed
- `CLAIMED` - Item has been claimed by its owner
