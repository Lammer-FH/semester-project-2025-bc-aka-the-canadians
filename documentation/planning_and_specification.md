## üéØ Project Idea & Motivation

The Campus Lost & Found Service is a mobile-first full-stack application that helps people on our campus report and recover lost and found items.
Users (students, faculty, staff) can report items they've found, which creates visible entries for others to browse and retrieve their lost belongings.

### Motivation:

Misplaced belongings are a common issue on large campuses. This app simplifies and streamlines the process of reuniting people with their lost property by:

- Providing an intuitive interface for reporting found items.
- Offering a searchable list of found objects.
- Organizing items by location and category.

## üß™ REST API Specification

You can find the REST API specification [here](pdfs/API_Specification.pdf). To create the PDF, we use this [HTML file](pdfs/API_Specification.html) and save it as a PDF.

### Assumptions & Decisions

- We decided to not implement endpoints that have no clear use case or are not needed for the MVP. Due to this some resources do not have all CRUD operations (i.e `users`).
- When a user wants to view a detailed report, we will return the item and location data as well. This is to avoid multiple requests to the server and to provide a more complete view of the report.
