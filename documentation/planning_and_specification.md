## üéØ Project Idea & Motivation

The Campus Lost & Found Service is a mobile-first full-stack application that helps people on our campus report and recover lost and found items.
Users (students, faculty, staff) can report items they've found, which creates visible entries for others to browse and retrieve their lost belongings.

### Motivation:

Misplaced belongings are a common issue on large campuses. This app simplifies and streamlines the process of reuniting people with their lost property by:

- Providing an intuitive interface for reporting found items.
- Offering a searchable list of found objects.
- Organizing items by location and category.
